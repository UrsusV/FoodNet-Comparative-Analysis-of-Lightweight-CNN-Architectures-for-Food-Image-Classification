# FoodNet

FoodNet benchmark for food image classification using lightweight CNNs (MobileNetV3, EfficientNet-B0, ResNet18). Includes transfer learning, training/evaluation pipeline, confusion matrices, and inference-time comparison on a 34-class food image dataset.


## ✨ Features
- Comparative analysis of MobileNetV3, EfficientNet-B0, ResNet18 for offline CPU inference
- Pretrained models fine-tuned on food-101 or custom 34-class dataset
- Training scripts with Weights & Biases logging
- Model evaluation: accuracy, F1-score, inference latency
- Confusion matrices and performance tables
